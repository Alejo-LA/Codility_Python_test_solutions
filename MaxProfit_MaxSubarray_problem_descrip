You are given an array A of stock prices over a period of N days. 
Calculate the maximum possible profit (you are allowed to buy only once, 
and sell only once at any following date).

Maximum subarray problem:


For example, for the array of values [−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4], 
the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is [4, −1, 2, 1], with sum 6.
Some properties of this problem are:
  1 If the array contains all non-negative numbers, then the problem is trivial; 
    the maximum subarray is the entire array.
  2 If the array contains all non-positive numbers, 
    then the solution is the number in the array with the smallest absolute value 
    (or the empty subarray, if it is permitted).
  3 Several different sub-arrays may have the same maximum sum.

Two big ideas:
First: splitting on two disjoint sets
Second: every interval has a final point ("sum ending at position i")
